  <h1>EMKAY Coronavirus (COVID-19) status</h1>
  <h2>MARCH 20 UPDATE</h2>

  <p>As we are all aware, COVID-19 (aka the novel coronavirus) is having a tremendous impact on our nation’s people,
    their
    well-being, their lifestyles, their workplaces, and more. EMKAY leadership is here to reassure you that much like
    the
    rest of the country, we, too, are taking precautions to keep our employees and clients safe, while also ensuring we
    deliver on our promise to be your provider of fleet management solutions. This means continuing to be accessible,
    responsive, and expeditious for all of your daily fleet management needs, even in this time of nation-wide chaos and
    uncertainty.</p>


  <h2>EMKAY UPDATE – Itasca, IL HQ</h2>

  <p>Per the press release link below, Governor Pritzker of Illinois announced a statewide ‘stay at home’ order
    beginning
    Saturday, March 21st.</p>

  <h2>Chicago Tribune – Pritzker Stay at Home order</h2>

  <p>All of EMKAY’s HQ staff is prepared to work remotely next week. We knew it was a matter of time before this order
    would be issued, so EMKAY executed the plan described previously. Phones, network, website, and internal programs
    will
    all be accessible by remote employees.

    Although 3rd party vendor shut-downs may impact what can be accomplished, EMKAY’s staff will be working and ready to
    assist our clients and their drivers.</p>



  <h3>Tips to Reduce Fleet Driver Exposure to COVID-19 - Automotive Fleet Staff</h3>

  <p>While there are many offices that are closing down their physical locations and directing their employees to work
    remotely, there are still many fleet drivers that are out on the road. Whether you’re a delivery fleet driver, a
    roadside technician, or any other type of driver that interacts with other people, there are steps you can take to
    reduce the potential exposure to COVID-19 coronavirus.

    It all starts at the beginning of your shift, according to AAA. Before you leave your home, wash your hands
    thoroughly
    at the sink for 20 seconds with soap and water.

    Throughout your day, whenever you receive any sort of equipment, spray the equipment with disinfectant spray or wipe
    it down using disinfectant wipes. A good item to have while on the road is a pack of nitrile gloves. Wear gloves for
    every job you start through the day, to reduce the chance that you contract something from any given location you
    visit throughout the day.

    Following the completion of a job, disinfect your hands and wipe down your vehicle. Wipe down the inside of the
    vehicle, such as the door, dashboard, seat, door hand, and any exposed surfaces with spray disinfectant or
    disinfectant wipes after anyone enters your vehicle.

    Have a small trash bag to dispose of soiled gloves, towels and wipes; make sure that you dispose of that small trash
    bag at the end of each shift, according to AAA. A few items that you probably handle every day that might not be
    getting the attention it should is your credit card, corporate fuel card, or cash. These items can hold the virus so
    it’s a good idea to wear gloves whenever you handle these items.

    At the end of your shift, wash your hands again thoroughly at a sink for 20 seconds with soap and water.

    To make sure that you’re using products that will properly disinfect your vehicle, the Environmental Protection
    Agency
    has a site that lists all the products that currently meet its criteria for use against COVID-19.</p>

  <h3>IMPACT: Vehicle Licensing Services</h3>
  <p>Along with the rest of the fleet management industry, we are experiencing significant constraints when it comes to
    our
    vehicle licensing services. Each state has enacted separate regulations with regards to their DMV operations,
    therefore making initial registration, registration renewal, license plate distribution, title corrections or
    transfers, and the like more difficult to obtain and issue to our customers. These could be due in part to DMV
    on-site
    employee reductions or the extent of individual DMVs’ own capacities to enable employees to work remotely; either
    way,
    we are doing our absolute best to ensure these functions operate as normal as possible.

    The American Automotive Leasing Association (AALA) and American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA)
    have issued official resources on the impacts each state’s DMV locations are experiencing due to COVID-19. They have
    been updated through the morning of Tuesday, March 24th, and have been provided to all of our CSS teams; if you have
    a
    question or concern about a particular one of your vehicles in a given state, please contact your CSS team for the
    latest DMV updates we have on that state. AAMVA has also stated that updates can be found by accessing their
    website.</p>

  <h3>Rental Vehicles</h3>
  <p>Rental vehicles will only be available from select neighborhood locations and all major airport locations. Due to
    the
    reduced number of locations, not all vehicle types may be available. Contact EMKAY if you need a rental vehicles for

    a
    safe condition. You may also start seeing delays in obtaining certain parts that may create extra downtime.</p>

  <p>These services will continue but there may be extended wait times before a tow truck can respond for service in
    many
    parts of the country, especially in hard hit areas.</p>

  <h3>Driver Motor Vehicle Record Checks</h3>
  <p>The state of Pennsylvania has suspended all MVR reports until April 1. We anticipate other states, along with
    Provinces in Canada , may begin suspending this service if they do not offer a fully electronic solution. We are
